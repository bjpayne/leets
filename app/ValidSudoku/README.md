# 36. Valid Sudoku
[https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/)

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules:**

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input: </b> board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input: </b> board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
<b>Output: </b> false
<b>Explanation: </b> Same as Example 1, except with the <b>5</b> in the top left corner being modified to <b>8</b>. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
</pre>

**Constraints:**
- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`
